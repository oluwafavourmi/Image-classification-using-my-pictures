# Image-classification-using-my-pictures

This project is a simple one, it involves me creating a Convolutional Neural Network from the scratch and which has:
    1. The convolution layer
    2. Filters
    3. The pooling layer
    4. The dense layer
    5. an output layer
The convolutional neural network was trained using my personal pictures and achieved an accuracy around 85%
